== Prerequisites

Ansible has multiples ways to be installed but in general, you have to:
* Install the Control Node
* Configure Ansible Clients.

For this laboratory we only need to perform the installation of the control node since
the clients are already configured. This lesson explores this aspect.

[#installingcontrolnode]
