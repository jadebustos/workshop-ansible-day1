== Introduction

An inventory defines a collection of hosts that Ansible will manage. These hosts can also be assigned to groups, which can be managed collectively. Groups can contain child groups, and hosts can be members of multiple groups. The inventory can also set variables that apply to the hosts and groups that it defines.

Host inventories can be defined in two different ways. A static host inventory can be defined by a text file. A dynamic host inventory can be generated by a script or other program as needed, using external information providers.

Inventories are written using INI format:

```ini
[all:vars]
ansible_user=ansible

[load-balancers]
lb1.example.com
lb2.example.com

[web-servers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
192.168.1.123

[db-servers]
mysql.example.com
```
