= Ansible Playbooks

[#introduction]
== Introduction

We have learned how to execute AdHoc commands. 

Ansible also allows us to write "scripts" which is a set of tasks to be executed in a host or group of hosts.

In this section we are going to learn how to write these "scripts" in ansible. These "scripts" are called **ansible playbooks**.

[#firstansibleplaybook]
=== My first ansible playbook

Ansible playbooks are written in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML]:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---
- hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present

IMPORTANT: Only the space character can be used for indentation, tab characters are not allowed.

The above playbook creates a user named **newbie** with an UID of **4000** in those servers where we execute the playbook.

We can add as many tasks as we need:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---
- hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
    - name: oldie exists with UID 4001
      user:
        name: oldie
        uid: 4001
        state: present

IMPORTANT: Tasks order in the ansible playbook are important due to all tasks will be execute in the same order that they are listed in the playbook.

The **user** ansible module can create a linux user you can check all the parameters in two ways:

1. Console

   $ ansible-doc user

2. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html[Web Documentation]

IMPORTANT: Be certain to check the documentation for your ansible version when you check the web documentation.

[#configureclients]
=== Configure clients to run ansible tasks

Before running tasks in a client we need to configure it first.

We need to create an user to ansible connect to the client. Connect to one of the clients, for instance to **servera**. Create an user named **ansible** with password **redhat**:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@servera ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for student:
[root@servera ~]# useradd -md /home/ansible ansible
[root@servera ~]# passwd ansible
Changing password for user ansible.
New password:
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[root@servera ~]#

Connect to the workstation and check if there is a public/private key:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ ls -lh .ssh/
-rw-r--t--. 1 student student   62 Jul 7 2021 config
-rw-------. 1 student student 1.7K Jul 7 2021 lab_rsa
-rw-r--r--. 1 student student  395 Jul 7 2021 lab_rsa.pub
[student@workstation ~]$

TIP: If no public/private key is create it can be created using **ssh-keygen** command.

As we are going to execute ansible tasks from the **workstation** server to the **servera** using the **ansible** user we have just created we need to authenticate in the client, **servera**, so we need to copy the public key:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/lab_rsa.pub ansible@servera.lab.example.com
...
[student@workstation ~]$

IMPORTANT: Lab servers are already configured so we do not need to copy the public key.

Connect from **workstation** to **servera**:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh ansible@servera.lab.example.com
[ansible@servera ~]$

Create a simple inventory file in **workstation** with only **servera** host and check if ansible is able to run tasks in **servera**:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ cat hosts
servera.lab.example.com
[student@workstation ~]$ ansible -i hosts -m ping all
servera.lab.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
[student@workstation ~]$

NOTE: As we have not specified any user ansible uses by default the user that executes ansible, so the **student** user was used.

In **workstation** create a playbook, modify the inventory and execute the ansible playbook:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ cat hosts
servera.lab.example.com ansible_user=ansible
[student@workstation ~]$ cat first.yaml
---
- hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
[student@workstation ~]$ ansible-playbook -i hosts first.yaml

You will see something like this:

image::ansible-playbook-01.png[]

Tha ansible module **user** is trying to create an user. This task requires **root** privileges so we need to modify the playbook:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@workstation ~]$ cat first.yaml
---
- hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
      become: yes
[student@workstation ~]$ ansible-playbook -i hosts first.yaml

image::ansible-playbook-02.png[]

Now the error is a different one. The problem is that sudo required a password and this password has not been given.

If we need to run tasks which need to be executed using **root** privileges we need to configure the user who runs the tasks in the client with passwordless sudo. 

In **servera** we need to create **/etc/sudoers.d/ansible** file as **root** user:
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[student@servera ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for student:
[root@servera ~]# cat /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
[root@servera ~]#

TIP: Use your favorite editor to create the **/etc/sudoers.d/ansible** file.

After creating the file go to the **workstation** and execute the playbook again:

image::ansible-playbook-03.png[]

You can go to the **servera** and check that a new user has been created.

[#steps]
== Steps

1. Configure the other servers from **b** to **d** to run tasks using the **ansible** user. Configure one of them with a different user than **ansible**.
2. Check that you can run tasks in all servers using the ansible ping module.
