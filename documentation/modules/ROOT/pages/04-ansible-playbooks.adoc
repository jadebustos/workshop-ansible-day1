== Introduction

In section <<ansibleadhoccommands>> we have learned how to execute AdHoc commands. 

Ansible also allows us to write "scripts" which is a set of tasks to be executed in a host or group of hosts.

In this section we are going to learn how to write these "scripts" in ansible. These "scripts" are called **ansible playbooks**.
